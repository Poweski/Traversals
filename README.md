# Traversals

- Presents the flow of the breadth-first (**BFS**) and depth-first (**DFS**) search algorithm and gives the order in which the vertices are visited.
- When selecting the next vertex to visit, it uses lexical order.
- Shows the state of the forest of disjoint sets after each step of the algorithm for finding connected components for a graph.
